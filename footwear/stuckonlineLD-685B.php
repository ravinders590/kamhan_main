The plastic plate can choose the 2-step adjusted to match the shape of shoes and also can be quickly changed for different sizes of shoes and also can change automaticly between left and right shoe. The vamp highly attached after lasting. Save labor cost and environmental protection.<br />
			With the design of specially tracked wipers, the all-around multipoint "TEFLON" press fitting ensures the upper to be evenly attached to the last After lasting, no protrusion will occur.
－The electric system is controlled by PLC and supported with the touch screen and diagrammatic operation system. There have 120 groups (A.B.C.D.E.F) of memory saving and deletion function.The machine also has self-examination function.<br />
The design of free calibrating of toe head pressing stroke supplies the most stable pressing force.

            <p class="special_manage">LD-685B This machine is fully hydraulic controlled system. lt is suitable for outsole attaching of jogging shoes, walled sports and casual shoes or other shoes. The operation of outsole pressing, side pressing and front-rear pressing can be accomplished simultaneously or separately. The heavy pressing force and firm attaching effect save more labor cost. This automatic sole attaching mechanism makes an even and prefect pressing which helps the shoe industry upgraded.<br />
			
The hydraulic automatic balancing system is adopted for the mechanism of pressing rods. The height of rods not need adjust which helps simplify operation. The design of automatic bias angles setting makes shoes locating easily.<br />

The side attaching adopts total hydraulic action. Both sides of the shoe have the shape pressing block which has been special designed to make a tight pressing according to the shoe shape and ensure the best performance of the side adhensive.
<br />
This machine is special suitable for all kinds of sports shoes, like men’s and women’s casual shoes, etc. There is a pressure adjusting function for each action.
